DevOps is about more than building CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC),
and developing Disaster Recovery (DR) plans, its about developing automation to
drive greater efficiencies within and across your business units.

We'll create the tools your teams want, but didnt know they need, to help them
work more quickly, efficiently, and intelligently, while significantly 
reducing human error.

These systems may include, but are not limited to:
* tools to automate your software build, testing, and deployment pipelines
* tools to automate the creation and configuration of your infrastructure
* tools to improve resiliency, and identify cloud cost savings
* tools to automate/simplify data migrations between 3rd party systems
* tools to help non-technical teams work more efficiently
