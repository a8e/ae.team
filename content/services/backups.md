Everyone understands the benefits of DR plans and backups, but when was
the last time you completed a DR drill? Do you know when your systems
were last backed up? Do you know what the impact of backups on your live
systems are? Do you know how long it will take to fully restore from
backup? Is this process automated?

Let us take care of the headache of creating, validating, and automating
these processes for you, so that you can focus on your core competencies!
