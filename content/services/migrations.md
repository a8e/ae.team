Companies have, over the past 10-15 years, enthusiastically embraced
'Cloud Native' technologies and clouds. However, some organisations
have preferred OPEX (Operational Expenditure) over CAPEX
(Capital Expenditure) - e.g. banks - due to a variety of reasons.

Let us help you embrace 'Cloud Native', while remaining 'Cloud Agnostic',
and agressively optimising for cost!
