(Business) Process Engineering, a term borrowed from chemical engineering, is
the term we use for working with businesses to understand their business processes,
both within teams, and across the company, with a view to identifying opportunities
for optimisation. Should  businesses elect to proceed with recommendations, we either
identify potential 3rd party tools and services, or develop bespoke systems to cater
to their particular requirements - whilst ensuring maximum compatibility
with other systems.

What might this look like?
* Helping your marketing team to templatise campaign setups
* Creating automations for your finance, sales, marketing, or customer success teams to reduce human error and improve throughput
* Developing tools to  optimise data flows within/between two or more 3rd party SaaS solutions your teams rely on
* Building QA automation to help them quickly validate new software releases
