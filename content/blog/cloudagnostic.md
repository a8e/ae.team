Being cloud agnostic means that an organization is not tied to a specific cloud provider or platform. It allows the organization to choose the best cloud solution for their specific needs, rather than being limited to a single provider.

Some benefits of being cloud agnostic include:

Flexibility: Being cloud agnostic gives an organization the flexibility to choose the best cloud solution for their specific needs. This can help them to optimize their infrastructure for cost, performance, and other factors.

Vendor independence: Being cloud agnostic allows an organization to avoid vendor lock-in, which can occur when an organization becomes heavily reliant on a single cloud provider. This can give the organization more negotiating power and help them to avoid being at the mercy of a single provider.

Avoiding risk: Relying on a single cloud provider can expose an organization to risk if that provider experiences outages or other issues. Being cloud agnostic allows an organization to spread their risk across multiple providers, reducing the impact of any individual provider's issues.

Cost savings: Being cloud agnostic allows an organization to choose the most cost-effective cloud solution for their specific needs. This can help them to reduce their overall cloud costs.

Improved resilience: Being cloud agnostic can help an organization to improve their overall resilience and ability to recover from outages or other issues. By using multiple cloud providers, an organization can benefit from the built-in redundancy and failover capabilities of different platforms.

Automate Everything advises all its customers to remain 'cloud agnostic', wherever possible, if there isnt a significant cost associated with doing so. This is easier in the context of containerised microservices, but with the right planning and foresight, it can be done for most products and services.
