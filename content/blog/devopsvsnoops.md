According to OpenAI, "DevOps is a term that refers to a set of practices and tools that aim to improve the collaboration and communication between software developers and operations teams. It is based on the idea that developers and operations teams should work together throughout the entire software development lifecycle, rather than working in silos. This can help organizations to deliver software faster and more reliably.

NoOps, on the other hand, refers to a approach to software development that aims to eliminate the need for dedicated operations teams. Instead, developers are responsible for managing the entire software development process, including deployment and operations. This approach is made possible by the use of cloud-based platforms that provide automated tools and services for building, deploying, and managing applications.

Both DevOps and NoOps aim to streamline the software development process and make it easier to deliver high-quality software quickly. However, DevOps focuses on improving collaboration between developers and operations teams, while NoOps aims to eliminate the need for dedicated operations teams altogether."

And yet, today the majority of organisations report an increase in the implementation of DevOps practices, and the hiring of DevOps professionals.

Some of the things we think are contributing to the continued increase in DevOps practices:
- Companies wishing to retain ownership and control of their infrastructure and data, and rapidly respond to issues
- Benefits of having in-house DevOps professionals outweighs their overall cost
- The rate of innovation within NoOps systems is often far slower than desirable, often slowing down innovation within their customer infrastructures
- 'DevOps' definition varies by organisation - to some, its a CI/CD technician, to others its an architect/engineer/automator of things, making it difficult to nail down

All in, we think of 'DevOps Engineers' as a modern day 'McGuyver' in the IT world: S/He is one of the most resourceful people you know, who can do incredible things with some string, a stick of bubblegum, and a pen-knife. In a world where everyone is becoming more specialised, it helps to have a few 'Jack of all Trades' around to glue things together with 'bubblegum and stickytape'.
