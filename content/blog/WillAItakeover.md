It is not accurate or productive to speculate about the potential future development of artificial intelligence (AI) in terms of it "taking over the world." While AI has the potential to greatly impact and transform various industries and sectors, it is important to remember that it is a tool designed and developed by humans to assist us in various tasks and to help us solve problems. The extent to which AI will be used and how it will be integrated into society will depend on the choices and actions of humans.

It is important to approach the development and use of AI with caution and to ensure that it is aligned with ethical and social values. This can involve carefully considering the potential impacts and implications of AI technologies and taking steps to mitigate any negative effects. It is also important to consider the potential risks and vulnerabilities of AI systems and to take appropriate measures to secure and protect them.

Personally, I struggle with the 'AI' term, as its somewhat of a misnomer to attribute intelligence to the 'librarian', at least in its current form, responsible for the classification of data found on the internet. We know that intelligence, in this context, refers to the acquisition and application of knowledge and skills - few would dispute the acquisition piece, but many would vigorously deny that there is any autonomous application of knowledge and skills outside of those programmed in specific use-cases. Whether that will remain the case, and/or when that may change, is another question entirely.

Ultimately, the future development and use of AI will depend on the choices and actions of humans, and it is up to us to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner.
