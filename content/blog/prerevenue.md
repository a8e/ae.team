As of 2023, we're on a war-path with Cloud Cost Overspend. With this in mind, we've decided to offer our Cloud Cost Optimisation and DevOps Services to pre-revenue startups free of charge.

As a founder, you want to validate your ideas as efficiently as possible, while minimising costs and remaining agile. These priorities are often at odds with one another, and costs spiral as
a result. One only needs to consider investments in companies like Spot, Zesty, Granulate, CloudHealth, CloudAbility, Densify, Opsani, etc, to appreciate the magnitude of the problem.
If you want to maximise profitability and attract VCs, you'll want to show scalability at the lowest price point - both for staffing and architecturally - and we will help you do that.

Why do we do this? A few reasons, really. Firstly, we know how difficult it is to start a business from scratch - countless competing priorities, spiralling costs, (un)known
unknowns, emotional challenges, finding customers, etc - so we've decided to help. Secondly, when startups build an experienced team and implement the right technical policies early, 
less time and money is wasted. Thirdly, we want to build symbiotic relationships with (co)founders and their companies, and we think a great way of doing this is by building trust and
offering value early. Finally, by providing our expertise early, we deepen our understanding of the challenges faced by startups, and are better placed to create more automation to
simplify and improve the journey of future entrepreneurs.

How do we do this? By keeping our costs as lean as possible, by building as much automation as possible, and by helping startups to become profitable as quickly as possible. Only once your
business has begun generating revenue, and you're happy with our service, will our fees commence - and, if we havent already mentioned it, our Fractional DevOps Service is seriously
competitive, so you'll remain 'Prom King/Queen' to your prospective VC throughout!
